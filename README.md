### Hi there ꩜ .ᐟ

My name is **Yibei** (it means northern happiness).

I currently work as an **AI Engineer @ Capgemini**, but in my free time, I research the confluence of neuroscience and deep learning.<br>
I'm particularly interested in computational neuroscience frameworks, especially those that model **agency** and **adaptive behaviour**.


**Research Focus**

* **Predictive Processing** & the **Free Energy Principle (FEP)**
* **Active-Inference-style Modelling**
* The emergence of **Agency** and **Meta-Cognition**
* Designing agents capable of **Adaptive Behaviour**
